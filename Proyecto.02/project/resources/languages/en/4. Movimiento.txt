Movement:

Anyway, we will have to start with the basics. Are you able to see that panel with a green light point?

That is the Eye of the Pattern, a powerful artifact that will allow you to see the areas you have explored in the labyrinth and your current position. In the past it also served to detect enemies, but one of our apprentices threw the Eye down the stairs and, well, you can imagine the rest.

As for how to navigate the mazeâ€¦ Well, these are pretty extreme corridors. You will have to move forward and, in the case of wanting to change direction, you will have to turn to the right or left.

Well, what are you waiting for? We don't have all day, go ahead.
