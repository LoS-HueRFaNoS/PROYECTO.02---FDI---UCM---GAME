Welcome:

Greetings, adventurers.

My name is- Well, I don't think my name is relevant right now. All you need to know is that I, the almighty Archmage of the Keep, have decided to give you a chance to abandon your insignificant lives and embrace greatness, on an adventure brimming with glory and riches.

Your only job will be to eliminate the source of evil power emanating from the catacombs below the Keep and retrieve the trigger from that source, so that I, its rightful owner, can secure it. In exchange for your services, you will be generously rewarded with the treasures you find during your exploration.

To be honest, it's not like you could say no either. After all, the executioner told me that they planned to get rid of you in a few days due to a shortage of cells. Apparently there has been an increase in revolts among the plebs because we nobles do not care about their welfare. Can you believe it? Fallacies, each and every one of them Of course I worry! After all, I have paid a large amount of coins for your release. I wouldn't want to have to hire more people, so please be careful not to die inside the dungeon.

Sincerely, the Archmage.
