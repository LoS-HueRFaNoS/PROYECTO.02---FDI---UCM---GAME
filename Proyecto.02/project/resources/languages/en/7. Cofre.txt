Chest:

Why have you stopped?

A chest? Like a chest? We don't have time for this and- Damn, I knew I didn't have to hire farmers. As soon as you see an opportunity to get rich, you forget about everything else

How did I promise you all the riches you will find? Yes, I guess I did.

Do you see that key that just appeared in front of you? It is the Master Key, an ancient artifact that will allow you to unlock the chests that you find in the dungeon.

If you want to see what you have achieved, use your inventory.
