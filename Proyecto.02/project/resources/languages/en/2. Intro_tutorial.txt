Tutorial:

What do you mean, what should you do? Weren't you supposed to be brave adventurers, hardened in a thousand battles?

How were you farmers?

Damn, when I hired you I didn't do it with the idea of having to explain how to be adventurers.

Anyway, with the basic training you have received and my valuable lessons, I hope you are already prepared for the worst, well ... well, you will discover it yourself.

Use with care the powers that according to your predominant character I have granted you.
