Game over:

Hello? Does anybody hear me?

Are you the group of adventurers that has finished off the Lich and recovered the orb of power?

Wonderful, this ... At first I thought to thank you for your contribution, but a little problem has arisen: Our Archmage has decided to use the orb, so now he is a Lich and has restored the labyrinth and- Can you recover the core again? evil one? I have just been given the position of Archmage, and the paperwork makes it quite difficult to be able to go in person to solve the problem, so ... I'm counting on you, partner

Do not disappoint me!
